I initially wrote this in 2007, as I was fed up with some of
the online web forms that had almost non-existent error checking capabilities.

I have made this Javascript library available now in 2013. Please feel
free to use it for validating your website forms. All I ask is that you
abide by the liberal BSD licence, and give me the credit for initial
development of formcheck.

Any feedback is welcome. You can contact me at keith@karsites.net

I specialise in PHP on LAMP or WAMP. I'm currently available looking for
work as the following:

Javascript developer
Web developer
PHP & MySQL back end developer
Linux System Administrator
IT support technician
